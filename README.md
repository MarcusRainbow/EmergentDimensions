# Emergent Dimensions

 Exploring the emergence of finite dimensionality in models such as Quantum Loop Gravity.

 We start with a toy universe, made up of points that are not specified in some cartesian geometry (that would be begging the question). Instead, the points are specified purely in terms of the distances between them.

 Assuming Euclidean geometry (or near Euclidean, anyway), we count the minimum number of dimensions required to reproduce the distances between the points.

 Normally, I'd expect the number of dimensions to be one less than the number of points, unless we are lucky with the distances.

 We now experiment with ways to evolve the points. Is there a natural evolution or dynamic that results in a small finite number of dimensions?
