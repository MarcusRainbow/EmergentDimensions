# Emergent Dimensions

 Exploring the emergence of finite dimensionality in models such as Quantum Loop Gravity.

 We start with a toy universe, made up of points that are not specified in some cartesian geometry (that would be begging the question). Instead, the points are specified purely in terms of the distances between them.

 Assuming Euclidean geometry (or near Euclidean, anyway), we count the minimum number of dimensions required to reproduce the distances between the points.

 Normally, I'd expect the number of dimensions to be one less than the number of points, unless we are lucky with the distances.

 We now experiment with ways to evolve the points. Is there a natural evolution or dynamic that results in a small finite number of dimensions?

## A Creation Myth

 In the beginning, everything was without form and void. There were no spatial dimensions, but a very large number of points separated by widely varying distances. In fact, it would not be possible to define spatial dimensions to accomodate the points, because the distances between them was inconsistent -- for example, it might be a shorter distance to go from one point to another via a third point than to go direct.

 Within this chaos, there was a force. Maybe it was attractive, maybe repulsive -- let's call it inflation for now. In later eras of just three spatial dimensions, the force might follow an inverse square law, but for now, it is extremely sensitive to distance, because if the world is dimensional at all, it has a very large number of dimensions.

 This early universe was rather like a many dimensional onion, with each layer of the onion being made up of points roughly the same distance from each other. The effect of the force was to blow the layers apart, and as they grew further apart the difference in force grew without limit.

 At the end of the first day, all that was left in our universe was a collection of points the same distance apart -- mathematically we call this a _simplex_. There was an onion shell larger than ours, but so much larger and slower that its smallest division of time would be greater than an eternity for us. There was once an onion shell smaller than ours, but it had gone through its entire lifecycle. Galaxies had appeared. On a few of them, intelligent civilisations had come and gone. The galaxies had moved further apart and grown colder until there was nothing left but black holes which had evaporated. And all in a flicker of an instant for the universe that is our onion shell. And the onion shells inside and outside of these are inconceivable to us.

 The second day was a day of rest. The whole of our universe was made up of points that were exactly the same distance apart, and defining a spatial universe with as many dimensions as points (actually one less). Nothing happened for a long time. (Okay, a long time compared with the first day, but a vanishingly small time by our standards today.)

 On the third day, tiny differences between the distances appeared. That is where our simulation appears, with a universe that is initially very nearly an equilateral simplex but with tiny differences in momenta or distances.
